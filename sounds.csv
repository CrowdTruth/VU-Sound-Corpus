DJ Chronos,245,0,"The first of hopefully many metallic atmospheres to kick off my ""Metal Atmosphere Project"". I was inspired by the ingenious atmospheres used in the Silent Hill games (particularly Silent Hill 3) which are basically reverberant sounds of clanking, screeching, and scraping metal, dissonant drones, and chilling screams. Anyway, backstory aside, this is the result of the inspiration...pretty much a carbon copy of the Silent Hill atmospheres but made from legal sounds hosted by Freesound. :D

The sound of the bass itself is unprocessed, muffled and very distorted because the sound energy caused bars and the ventilation system of the night club to resonate so very much. Recorded with Zoom H4n, which handled this very high sound pressure level in the bass range so good. Please rate, comment and share. In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure.

DJ Chronos,39,16,"This is a remix of volivieri's ""small_pipe_bang.wav"".
I cut out the third metallic ting sound from the recording and pitched it down 40 notes. I added a Parametric EQ and accented the upper and lower mid freq ranges to achieve an optimum metallic clank sound. I then added another EQ that deals with more precise signal processing, and filtered out some unwanted high end sounds. I slapped on some fast decaying reverb and voila! 

I was watching the Silent Hill movie today and I realized how much the sound designers relied on metallic textures to create a mechanical atmosphere so I hunted for some good clanky sounds that I could mess around with to mimic those sounds. Thanks for the great sample volivieri, I'll be back for more no doubt!

jaiserpey,0,16,"This sound was created with the technique invented and developed in my PhD, called Histogram Mapping Synthesis (HMS). HMS is based on Cellular Automata (CA) which are mathematical/computational models that create moving images. In the context of HMS, these images are analysed by histogram measurements, giving as a result a sequence of histograms. In a nutshell, these histogram sequences are converted into spectrograms which in turn are rendered into sounds. Additional DSP methods were developed to control the CA and the synthesis so as to be able to design and produce sounds in a predictable and controllable manner.

Tomlija,25,16,"This is the sound of a big giant air pump inflating some stupid huge tent intended for cocktails and what not. Last year it was located near the place where river Sava flows into the river Danube. I suppose it was intended for snobby gatherings after the tennis matches that were held on the tennis courts just next to it. At least, I stole their sound. In my humble opinion, this sound is very applicable and versatile. You can use it as a sound of a space ship floating somewhere far in the galaxy, or as a sound of some super-humid boiler-room, or anywhere where the long droning low-pitched sound is needed, or as a build-up part of a scene in a horror movie, for example...or just make a trippy song out of it.

Tomlija,14,16,"I was walking through an unknown part of the city near the river, through the neighborhood made out of slums, I have never seen before, in search of...something. Sounds, I guess. It was 3 am. All of a sudden, a giant dog (I recognized it was a Bullmastiff) started barking at me like crazy. I thought he was going to rip me apart, but the fence stopped him from doing that :) So, instead of playing with him I decided to share his angry barking with the world. The slums are very close to each other and the reverb is zero-to-none, which is cool for this sample in particular. Enjoy! Recorded with Zoom H4n. Please rate, comment and share.

Believe me, recording kids at play is not EASY AT ALL! :D These kids that you can hear in this sample are playing soccer on the imaginary field, and, of course, they have imaginary goals. :) First off, they are pretty quiet, but somewhere in the middle of the sample they start fighting if one of them actually 'scored' or not :) Hence, the loud shouting, screaming and yelling (even I, whose mother tongue is Serbian couldn't realize what they are saying:) In the end, they are like all cool and what not and they all end their game peacefully.

monnie101,2,20,"Zip twisting mechanism sound, then a drop glug sound. Also sound like a bottle glug.

USE EXAMPLES: You can use this in a number of ways if you edit it.

1. Parking meter.
2. Edit/cut the sound so that it sounds like you are using a drink vending machine. 
3. Use the end glug sound as bottle being put down. Or copy and past the glug multiple times in a row to simulate someone heavily drinking from a bottle.
4. Glug sound can be used as something dropping in water.

mojomills,11,24,"Hello all!
I recorded this sample today, 10-11-2012 in LA, CA, USA.

I needed a radio tuning sample and I wasn't pleased with the ones I found, so I recorded one with my Zoom H2!

I realized I actually didn't have a radio, so I went to a thrift store and bought one for $4.34.
It sounds perfect for what I need.

This sample is in 44.1khz, 24bit.

Enjoy, comment, and download!

Pooleside,4,24,"This is the sound of a gasoline engine powered vacuum which is towed behind a dump truck and sucks up leaves.  It moves slowly, at a walking pace or even slower.  A man walks alongside the machine and sweeps leaves into the vacuum.  There are often twigs and sticks and other things being swept up, and they make sharp cracking sounds.

The truck passes from left to right in front of my microphones.  I have little of the approach, but the tailing off as the truck moves away fades off very smoothly and steadily.  Two cars pass my position during this fade.  At the end, the men shut off the vacuum motor.

Attribution Information:

I'm afraid I threw that together 7 years ago when I would have been 14 years old. I can't really remember whether I used any other sounds to make it, or if I generated it (and definitely can't remember who needs attributed if sounds
were used). If you recognise any of your work in this - just give me a shout/report it; I've got no problem removing this, as I said; did it a long time ago and forgot I'd even made it.

So just be aware there are risks in using this and you'd probably be better just making a new better one to replace this anyway.

Tomlija,48,16,"Today I stumbled upon some cool road-workers, who were repairing the street. One of them was welding a piece of metal and I was like 'ok, this is something I gotta record and share with the world!' I went to the supermarket, bought a giant bottle of ice cold beer, returned to the place where they were working and I was like 'Yo, guys, wanna trade a beer for some of your sounds?' Since they are the coolest people in the world, they agreed. They let me record for about 10 minutes, even though they were very, very busy. Thank you, guys! Bad thing is that everything was happening in a very noisy street and had to process and edit the sounds, merge, filter, compress them and what not. In the end, I made it, and voila! In my humble opinion this is very applicable sound, even for something that has to do with science fiction, or as a possible build up in a horror visual piece or just put it in your visual as a sound of a vinyl record before the song is supposed to start. Enjoy, my dear fellow sound-lovers! Recorded with Zoom H4n. Please rate, comment and share.

Spleencast,7,16,"07 January 2010 - At the request of 1badcapri, djkenry, and Bersaelor - Using my own voice humming at the pitch of the effect, and then putting EQ, vocal transformer, chorus, pitch and reverb on it, I mocked up this effort to reproduce the Cylon robot ""sweeping"" sound from Battlestar Galactica.  It should loop well with some judicious trimmage.  

The result isn't an exact match, but I think I've captured the essence of it.  Enjoy!  :)

He and his assistant were incredibly gracious, they turned off the shop music, turned off their shop phone, connected up the antique phone, stayed fairly quiet, and even rang their own number for me whilst generously allowing me to record the sound of the phone ringing.  That was especially amazing because the phone was on special offer for £235.00 (retail price £299), so I didn't even have to buy the phone to get the sound of the ringer.

I extend my gratitude and appreciative thanks to my friend the owner, and his assistant in Curio Interiors.  <a href=""http://www.curioltd.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.curioltd.co.uk/</a>",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/,antique bakelite bell british english environmental-sounds-research field-recording foley phone ring ringer ringing ringtone rotary sfx telephone uk vintage zoom-h4n,https://www.freesound.org/people/Spleencast/sounds/88112/,https://www.freesound.org/data/previews/88/88112_1086669-hq.ogg,4.53846153846154,2,mp3,30.0,http://kyoto.let.vu.nl/~miltenburg/sounds/88112.mp3,44100.0,https://www.freesound.org/data/previews/88/88112_1086669-hq.mp3,1378,88112,phone-1952-bakelite-2-looped.mp3

Took snippets of this sample and pitched them up/down or re-pitched them (i.e., sample stretching). Applied various types of delay and reverb.

Applied EQ, to isolate mid or high frequencies in certain snippets.
Most of the metallic like sounds were the result of sample stretching and or spectral processing to warp the frequency contents of the sounds (i.e., invert the frequency contents of the sample: high frequencies become low frequencies and vice-versa).

Tomlija,14,16,"This is a typical sound of people waiting to buy tickets at the huge lobby of train station in Belgrade, Serbia.

Especially the vibe of the old and gritty sound of the station PA system that has been there since like forever. I think they haven't modernized it last 50 years, and that's the reason it sounds so cool, in my humble opinion. Recorded with Zoom H4n. Please rate, comment and share. In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure.

Tomlija,3,24,"This is the stereo 24 bit/48 kHz recording of an old Krups mini espresso machine, located at my old workplace. The machine seemed to be broken and it made this particular series of cool sounds during the start-up, right after pressing the 'ON' button. It sounded so awesome, and I immediately decided to record it with my Zoom H4n.

Please rate, comment and share.

In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure.

AlienXXX,3,16,"The first of a new sample pack hot out of the oven.

I suspect this would not show up if I was feeding the amp with an actual guitar sound due to the small level of in-line noise. But I was feeding the amp with a short drum sample just to create this glitch effect.I used a reverse gate in Ableton Live to cut out the main part of the sound (the drum sample) which would be too loud and increased the gain so the tail sound was clearly audible.",http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,amp-modelling amp-simulation crisp digital electronic noise glitch,https://www.freesound.org/people/AlienXXX/sounds/78901/,https://www.freesound.org/data/previews/78/78901_97763-hq.ogg,4.833333333333335,2,wav,2.66022675737,http://kyoto.let.vu.nl/~miltenburg/sounds/78901.mp3,44100.0,https://www.freesound.org/data/previews/78/78901_97763-hq.mp3,1411,78901,6505 raw tail.wav
