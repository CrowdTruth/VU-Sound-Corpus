One of them was welding a piece of metal and I was like 'ok, this is something I gotta record and share with the world!' I went to the supermarket, bought a giant bottle of ice cold beer, returned to the place where they were working and I was like 'Yo, guys, wanna trade a beer for some of your sounds?' Since they are the coolest people in the world, they agreed. They let me record for about 10 minutes, even though they were very, very busy. Thank you, guys! Bad thing is that everything was happening in a very noisy street and had to process and edit the sounds, merge, filter, compress them and what not. In the end, I made it, and voila! In my humble opinion this is very applicable sound, even for something that has to do with science fiction, or as a possible build up in a horror visual piece or just put it in your visual as a sound of a vinyl record before the song is supposed to start. Enjoy, my dear fellow sound-lovers! Recorded with Zoom H4n. Please rate, comment and share. In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure. Please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. I really try to keep an open mind for everything. Thank you. Peace.
