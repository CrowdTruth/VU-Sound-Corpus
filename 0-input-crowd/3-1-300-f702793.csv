In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure. Please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. I really try to keep an open mind for everything. Thank you. Peace.
